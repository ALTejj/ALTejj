- 👋 Hi, I’m @ALTejj a 16 almost 17 year old programmer :D
- 👀 I’m interested in C++ / Ruby programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift but i'm planning to use Ruby more often.
- 💞️ I’d really like to collaborate on C++ / Swift projects.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord at: ALT#0667.

- 💻 Speaking about programming I'm learning new concepts everyday, as it is important to have a good knowledge to solve problems.
- But languages are like tools, and programming is using one of all of these tools to write programs and solve problematics. So that is why I'm learning new concepts or even languages (like Ruby)
